make remark	make remarks	Therefore , I have three remarks to make .
address problem	address problems	What we have achieved together is something rather remarkable : we have changed the political discourse in Europe , we have established a constitutional framework for a Europe that can stand on its own feet in world affairs and deliver effective common policy to address our shared problems .
make remark	made remarks	This is a view that has perhaps been endorsed by the remarks recently made by the Dutch Foreign Minister , suggesting that we need to engage in a process of self-reflection with a view to deciding whether some policy areas should not be transferred back from European to national level .
pose question	poses questions	Every attack poses new questions which require new answers and pose new challenges that we have to address jointly through concrete action .
address question	address question	It does not address the question of how the current situation in Iraq evolved over the last two years and therefore fails to criticise the Bush Administration 's defiance of the UN in its rush to invade Iraq .
make remark	make remarks	Could you answer that before I make my other remarks ?
address question	address questions	Madam President , let me briefly address three questions .

make remark	made remark	A remark was made about the exaggerated figure .
address problem	address problem	The Royal Government of Cambodia has recently taken a number of positive initiatives to address the problem , including the signature of memoranda of understanding with Thailand on trafficking in women and children and on the management of migrant labour between the two countries , participation in the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative against Trafficking and the establishment of a Department of Anti-Human Trafficking in the Ministry of Interior in 2002 .
make remark	making remarks	I want to point out that President McAleese apologised fulsomely and without reservation within hours of making the remarks .
make remark	make remarks	At this point , however , and less diplomatically than the President of the Commission , I must also make some remarks about the World Social Forum , which proved to be something of a disappointment by comparison .
suggest idea	suggesting ideas	Yet even journalists who were generally in favour of the World Social Forum had to admit that its basic objective was not to produce a unified document suggesting concrete ideas for fear of spoiling the diversity of opinions , and that the resulting proposals contain many contradictions .
make remark	making remarks	I know our new Commissioner also shares this view in relation to the legacy of Mr Monti , because only recently she has been speaking at Bocconi University and making very similar remarks about Mr Monti 's contribution .
make remark	made remarks	Mr Barroso has made some cautious remarks about easing regulation but I fear it is unlikely to occur .
make remark	made remarks	I found the remarks that honourable Members have made very interesting and stimulating .

address problem	address problems	Finally , I would like to underline that by 2007 we will have made significant progress in establishing the information system and we hope to have the first results of the effectiveness of cost efficiency measures to address health problems .
address problem	addressed problem	In the light of the question from our Polish colleague , I would like to ask Commissioner McCreevy whether he would agree with me that this is exactly the sort of problem that will be fully addressed by the proposal for a directive on the internal market for services .

address problem	address problem	Two days ago , I met the President of the European Investment Bank and we have already started to prepare actions in an effort to address that problem .
address question	address question	Here , we would like to address the question of new Member States , but not in a way that would undermine the excellence of the programme .
address problem	address problems	I could be pristine and pure and say that I will make great speeches about it , get nothing through , offer no services directive at all and do nothing to address the problems facing us all over Europe .
address question	address questions	These are definitely not easy questions that can be addressed in a limited amount of time , but I agree that we need to address them in an open and tolerant way .
address question	address question	I believe that science and research funds should primarily address the question of excellence .

address question	address question	The final report will then need to address the question of whether , beyond the stocktaking of current practice , with its risks and benefits , an improved information strategy is needed and what elements could be included .
stimulate debate	stimulate debate	The first was to describe how the Commission had started the simplification process ; the second , to present a Commission working document analysing the principal figures of the sector , the implementation of the producer organisations and the related operational funds and budgetary aspects ; and the third , to stimulate a debate in the Council , the European Parliament and within the sector .
address question	address questions	As we now begin implementing what has been agreed , it is very important to say that Russia is a strategic partner , but at the same time we also have to speak with one voice and we have to address all the questions -- both the more difficult and the less difficult questions -- which I can assure you we did .
make remark	make remarks	I hope I will get injury time on Mr Muscat 's behalf for saying that , because I now want to make some warm remarks about the rapporteur , Mr Nassauer .
make remark	makes remarks	It makes essential remarks on where European decision-makers need to concentrate their efforts in the coming years .
address problem	address problem	If there is a real problem for young farmers in a Member State , the national strategy should address it and propose the appropriate measures .

pose question	posing questions	People in Europe are posing hard questions to us .
misinterpret word	misinterpreted words	Very few politicians will wish to speak out against such proposals , for fear that their words may be misinterpreted , but there is some concern that the link between the use of phthalates in toys and a risk to children has not been firmly established .
address problem	address problems	Without adequate funding for LIFE + , the positive steps to address these problems since the introduction of the current programme in 1992 will be reversed .
address problem	address problem	I welcome the steps that the Commission has finally taken to address the problem but I wonder what makes them so confident that a few years ' breathing space will really make any long-term difference .
address problem	address problems	At a time when the international community is galvanised to address the endemic problems that Africa faces , it is only appropriate that we look beyond poverty relief to the maintenance of good governance , transparency , the rule of law and respect for human rights for all African countries .

address question	address questions	We need to have a policy to address these questions and to take them forward .

stimulate debate	stimulating debate	That Green Paper is currently stimulating considerable and -- I would suggest -- welcome discussion and debate as to how barriers can be overcome in order to deliver significant energy savings by 2020 .
address problem	addressed problems	If there are problems that should be specifically addressed , for example if there are concerns over the poor and vulnerable and disadvantaged , then we should use alternative social measures to assist them and not fall for the short-term fix of cutting tax .
make remark	made remarks	I would refer him both to my introductory remarks and the remarks I have just made .
address problem	addressed problems	In my country and in most of the new Member States , there are serious large-scale problems that need to be clearly addressed with comprehensive interventions such as economic and social actions , aimed at the revitalisation of deteriorated inner cities and the renovation of large post-war prefabricated housing estates .
make remark	made remarks	I find it extraordinary that I should have to justify remarks I made on an incident that raise questions about its compatibility with Article 49 of the Treaty .
pose question	posed questions	Nevertheless , I should like to respond more precisely to the questions posed , in particular by Mr Schulz , who cited questions by Mr Rasmussen .
address question	addressed questions	It is not just a case of my staff constantly having dealt with these issues and addressed these questions at every level ; we have also made it perfectly clear that , if these projects are blocked and can not be completed shortly , then there will be no funding for them .

address problem	addressing problems	The European Union is the largest contributor of development aid in the world and therefore must continue to show real leadership when it comes to addressing humanitarian and development aid problems in the world .
corrupt mind	corrupt minds	Owing to technological progress , those ideas on children 's rights must now also be linked into cyber security , as we have seen the Internet -- despite its wonderful intent , brilliant innovation and the opportunities it presents to us all -- being used by people who wish to corrupt innocent minds and pervert the use of the Internet through trafficking in paedophilia and child pornography .
invest money	invested money	I am pleased and relieved to hear the Commissioner 's response because I have been lobbied by European retailers who have invested considerable money in Asia , have improved health and safety conditions and working conditions in Asian countries , and are bringing economic benefits both to Asian workers and to European retailers .
damage confidence	damaged confidence	I strongly hope that Iran will recommit itself to these processes and seize the opportunity to clarify its position , dispel misunderstandings and start restoring an overall confidence that has been badly damaged by recent remarks .
address problem	address problem	But once again , the EU assumes the attributes of a political state in order to address this problem and its pretensions are fully supported by a minister of Her Majesty 's Government .
make remark	made remarks	Indeed in the remarks that were made by my ministerial colleague the Foreign Secretary in this House this afternoon , he made clear that ' failure to sign off accounts for the eleventh successive year , which is very poor , affects the climate of debate in all our countries ' .
make remark	made remarks	. We wish to express our unequivocal criticism of the appalling and irresponsible remarks about Israel made by the President of Iran .
damage confidence	damage confidence	I fear that if meat potentially contaminated with low pathogenic avian influenza were to reach the food chain , it would damage consumer confidence in poultry meat and products in general .
address problem	address problems	There is no specific restriction on the pharmaceutical products covered , although there is acknowledgement that they are required to address public health problems , since that is in the context of the decision .
address problem	address problem	To address that problem , the Commission presented a new legislative proposal for batteries in 2003 that would extend the scope of existing Community legislation from batteries containing certain dangerous substances to all batteries placed on the Community market .
make remark	making remark	I believe that is absolutely right , but could you confirm to me and colleagues whether , in making that remark , you feel that you are just saying that on behalf of the Presidency , or are you speaking on behalf of the Council as a whole ?
manage job	manage job	If I do not manage a job in Brussels airport , perhaps I will manage one in Frankfurt airport , to where I often have to travel , given the length of the questions I face here in this Chamber .
address problem	address problems	My concern is two-fold : first , the extent of redundancy in the text -- there may be circumstances in which repetition is used to good effect , but I do not consider that this is one of them ; secondly , the range of issues covered -- I believe that the European Parliament should be taking seriously all aspects of the lives of women in the fisheries sector and doing its best to address the problems that affect them .
pose question	poses question	Uncertainty over funding -- not least as we await a new EU budget -- poses the question of whether more funds can be made available , and if so , how they should be allocated .
make remark	make remark	He had his full time , I did cut him off and I did make a remark concerning the case that he had raised , in a personal capacity .
pose question	posed questions	I will conclude by saying that what we heard from Mrs Gomes was most disturbing and serious and I hope the Commission will be able to give answers to the questions she posed .
make remark	making remarks	In conclusion -- and I am very much aware that I have not responded to many of the points made or taken up a number of the points -- NAMA is an important issue ; I shall address these other issues in remarks I shall be making in a week 's time -- let me just say that these multilateral trade talks are very important .
make remark	make remark	I would like to make a factual remark concerning the statement that the Court of Auditors has rejected our accounts .
stimulate debate	stimulate debate	What more can political parties and NGOs do to raise public awareness on European issues and stimulate public debate ?
address problem	addressing problem	I wish to thank the Commissioner warmly for the efforts she has invested in taking us this far in addressing this crucial problem .
make remark	make remarks	I would like to use this opportunity to make some general remarks about communications in general .
address problem	addressing problem	We have an old saying in Scotland that you can not polish a turnip and no amount of presentation will disguise the fact that the EU has a structural problem which we are not addressing .
address problem	address problem	However , we have abstained on this report as it is a missed opportunity to address a serious problem .

address problem	address problems	I support the establishment of human rights subcommittees under EU third country agreements , to be responsible for reviewing compliance with the clause , monitoring its application and implementation , and proposing actions to address democracy and human rights problems .
get disease	get diseases	There is a clear link between exercise and health , in terms of the diseases you might get if you do not move properly .
address question	address questions	So we care very much about what you have said , but we also believe that the various types of sources should be combined to address both questions which I underlined , one being the question of aiming for the top , of having the best for Europe ; and the second , the question of how to deal with the others which may not be in the best position today .
address problem	addressing problems	It is crucial that one reads carefully the cohesion guidelines prepared by the Commission , which try to give a clear message that the Member States , in addressing their problems in the regions , need to take into account the structural and cohesion funds which are important in this respect for catching up with the Lisbon goals .
invest money	investing money	It is obvious that cooperation at EU level could show the best ways of using and investing the money .
invest money	invested money	In the European Union , approximately 55 % of private money is invested , compared to 45 % of public money .
address problem	address problem	The problem exists independently of the problem of depleted stocks , and we need to address it if we want to regain sustainable fisheries in the long-term interests of the fishermen themselves .
make remark	made remarks	I was very happy with some of Commissioner Verheugen 's remarks this morning , which were made more from the perspective of industrial policy .
address problem	address problem	It became evident that we needed to address this problem , despite it not being entirely new .
attract worker	attracted workers	Thirdly , skilled workers from third countries should be attracted , but according to our working group , we should not consider immigration as a single solution to Europe 's future demographic and labour market problems .
address problem	addressing problems	What seemed like an extremely logical system at the time to the majority of Parliament -- not to all of us -- has real problems that need addressing .
make remark	made remarks	Let me say that I am very happy with the statements of nearly everybody in this debate , especially the remarks that have been made about this portfolio .
make remark	made remarks	We may not agree completely at every moment , on every subject , every dossier ; I do not agree with a couple of remarks that were made this evening because the way they were put does not reflect the truth and is not realistic .
address problem	address problems	The strategies were designed in order to address these problems but the situation is getting worse .
attract worker	attract workers	The rich world can attract health workers from other countries ; the consequences for poor countries is that they train health workers who leave the country , effectively providing a perverse subsidy to health services in developed countries , by shouldering the burden of training costs .
address problem	address problem	We must address this problem urgently .
address problem	address problem	As you know , we agreed on the need to address that problem through a whole range of measures .
saturate market	saturated market	The problem is that if you put a lot of extra chicken meat on to the world market -- which is already saturated -- and if you are not careful about using public funds to subsidise it , you may find that meat comes back to the European market .
address problem	address problems	I do not want to bind their hands , but I have clearly said that it is important that we try to address the problems upstream .
address problem	address problem	If we deregulate as much as possible in the developing countries , we will have a chance to address this problem .
address problem	address problems	We urge the Turkish Government to address in a comprehensive manner -- and not only from the security point of view -- the problems of this region and of its people , who are for the most part of Kurdish origin .

address problem	address problems	We would point out ; however , that the compromise deal struck between the parties fails to adequately address the problems that confront the European Union today .
invest money	investing money	. -- I agree with the honourable Member in that ideally , of course , an internal market covering almost the whole of Europe should have tax rules in place ; but these also need to be effective , and neighbouring countries and , if possible , countries outside the continent need to apply the same rules , otherwise we hand the EU public the possibility of investing its money abroad , where such rules do not apply .
reduce price	reduce prices	This means that the Energy Community could bring much more stability -- at least to prices -- and could even reduce prices for consumers .
read book	read book	-- Mr Verhofstadt , I believe that today you have written the next chapter of your book , which I , like many others , read with great attention and pleasure .

address question	address questions	I hope they can address the issue of hostages and detainees , as well as other pressing questions of violence , access and finances .
make remark	make remarks	Let me make a few strategic remarks at the outset .
make remark	make remarks	I am honoured by the opportunity to make a few remarks .
address problem	address problem	-- Achieving a European common policy on immigration and asylum is undoubtedly a priority , although the Member States have so far shown varying degrees of willingness to address the problem .

address question	address question	I will not try to address every question separately ; that would be an impossible task , given my limited speaking time .
address problem	address problem	But it is not yet possible to address the problem on a wider scale through the normal regulatory process .
organise production	organise production	I take this very seriously indeed , because I do not want my actions , as agreed by the Member States , to have the effect of making a bad situation worse by further disrupting or undermining the ability of companies to plan ahead and to organise their production , which , of course , is hampered if supply and production chains are undermined or disrupted by interventions such as these .
make remark	make remarks	on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group . - ( DE ) Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , as foreign and security policy coordinator for the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance , I should like to make a number of critical remarks .

address problem	address problems	Accordingly , my departments are now examining the costs and benefits of such a statute , as well as alternative measures to address the problems at stake .
address problem	addressed problem	This is a problem that has never been addressed with the urgency it deserves , despite the fact that a country of Malta 's size lends itself more easily to the development of creative alternatives .
stimulate debate	stimulate debate	With the Green Paper , the Commission intends to stimulate a debate over the use of trade defence instruments in Europe : countervailing , anti-dumping and safeguard measures .
address problem	address problem	, in writing . - ( HU ) In spite of increasing evidence pointing to the fact that natural energy sources have been used irrationally and excessively , and that daily life has become part of the worry about the sustainability of the natural environment , today humanity , and especially political leaders , lack a clear conception of how to address the problem .
make remark	made remarks	We hear some criticisms of your first year in government , but we recall the faint hearts who made similarly dismissive remarks about your first year at the Commission .
address question	addressed question	At the same time as being fair and credible we can be firm and rigorous , and we can expect Turkey to carry out reforms and respect citizens ' rights so that , for instance , the Kurdish question can be addressed or women 's rights , trade union rights and freedom of expression can be enhanced in Turkey thanks to the credible prospect of EU accession .
address problem	addressing problems	I fully support the Presidency in calling for a ' dispassionate dialogue on the matter ' , addressing the problems ' in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect ' .

address problem	address problems	It is our duty to address the problems of the poorest in Europe .
pose question	posing questions	Why am I posing so many questions now ?
damage confidence	damaged confidence	And I do hope that the reform aspect that we have really tried to promote will go on in the future , otherwise confidence in the Georgian Government will be very much damaged if the current crisis can not be solved in a democratic way .
address question	addressed questions	As far as transatlantic cooperation is concerned , we maintain regular contact with the United States authorities responsible for monitoring safe harbour - the Department of Commerce and the Federal Trade Commission - in the context of which questions relating to the protection of personal data are addressed .
invest money	invest money	Our aim should be to put Europe 's money where its mouth is , to invest money in high-voltage solar thermal power generation and political capital in the human relations across the Mediterranean Sea to make it possible .
address problem	address problems	However , it falls short in providing some safeguards relating to refugee and human rights , and fails to address the specific needs and problems of Member States like Malta , which are being affected to a disproportionate degree relative to their size , population and resources .
address problem	address problems	The reason for that is the depth of the analysis that had to go into the proposal , to guarantee that it is a really effective instrument to address the severe problems the sector is facing .

address problem	address problem	But it highlighted to me , in a simplified form , the problem that we are trying to address with this revision : as Commissioner Mandelson said , a revision that goes back some 20 years or more .
make remark	make remarks	Allow me also to make a couple of final remarks in that introductory statement .
address problem	address problem	I warmly welcome the comprehensive report which calls upon all Member States to address the problem in question with utmost seriousness .
address problem	addressing problem	The full implementation of the anti-corruption programme and action plan is key to addressing this serious problem .
attract worker	attract workers	The solution can not simply be to attract health workers from developing countries , where the shortage is even greater .
address problem	address problem	These include , for example , the question of how we can create the right work environment for workers in order to keep them in their home countries and , also , how we address the very serious problem of the brain drain .
make remark	make remarks	author . - Mr President , before we vote on the resolution I tabled on the accession process for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia , I wish to make three technical remarks so that everybody can decide on the correct texts .
address problem	address problem	What I really appreciate today is that all of us recognise that we have a problem and that we are ready to address this problem .
address problem	addressed problems	I hope now that the myriad problems created by the various Spanish authorities will be addressed and that such will be promptly resolved in the best interests of my constituents .
make remark	make remarks	I would now like to make a few remarks on the external security part of the new agreement , where the Presidency also plays a role in the negotiations .
address problem	addressed problem	in writing . - ( DA ) We voted in favour of the report on educating the children of immigrants , as the report addressed a current and relevant problem .
address problem	address problem	I think most European consumers would be genuinely shocked to realise that the EU does not already have in place legislation against illegal logging , and I suspect that all those who concluded , in response to the Commission 's own consultation , that legislation was the only way to really address the problem would not see the particular proposals by the Commission , the due-diligence system on its own , as sufficient to be able to address the problems that we face .
address problem	address problems	I think most European consumers would be genuinely shocked to realise that the EU does not already have in place legislation against illegal logging , and I suspect that all those who concluded , in response to the Commission 's own consultation , that legislation was the only way to really address the problem would not see the particular proposals by the Commission , the due-diligence system on its own , as sufficient to be able to address the problems that we face .
address problem	address problems	But we can only work by virtue of the people who come to us with problems and address them and their particular needs .
make remark	made remarks	One of the remarks that have been made by several members is about the fact that a lot of Member States are in fact backtracking on their Official Development Assistance ( ODA ) engagements .
address question	addressed question	Therefore we have addressed this question , and I am very happy that in the summer , we received a letter from Commissioner Barrot expressing the European Commission 's concern about this law , saying that the European Commission will keep a very close eye on it and make sure that any national legislation is in line with European legislation and principles .
address problem	address problems	I am in favour of all other efforts in terms of the combined platforms you have suggested to address the problems we face .

make remark	made remarks	Madam President , ladies and gentlemen , may I first of all thank and congratulate Mr Moorhouse for his admirable report , with which I almost entirely agree , and to thank him and others such as Mr Ford and Mr Pompidou for the kind remarks they have made about the evolution of Commission policy and my role in it .
make remark	made remark	Therefore , I gladly withdraw the particular remark I made which I know he felt very deeply about .

address problem	addressed problem	I am grateful to the honourable Member for that question because it raises another very real problem which has to be addressed in the code .

make remark	made remark	Having made that preliminary remark , I should say that the PPE Group supports the Evans report .
address problem	addressed problem	I trust the Commission will take careful account of Mr Howitt 's report from this House this evening , for he has not only identified problem areas , but offered constructive criticism as to how the problems can be addressed in order to make application of the guidelines more effective , thereby contributing to greater transparency and efficiency .

make remark	made remarks	I must stress that these remarks are made with no consideration of nationality or political persuasion or membership of clubs or secret societies but because over the years - and I could list them if there was more time - this House has been let down by poor administration in DG VI and Mr Jean Feidt should carry that responsibility .

address question	address questions	We must address all the questions of food , health , the economy and political stability in one programme , if that is possible .
invest money	invested money	So I wholeheartedly agree with the establishment of the public-private partnership arrangement to ensure that the monies and the extra revenues which are created because of the single market within the European Union are put back into the European Union rather than allowing money which is invested in pension funds and so on to be invested in countries outside the European Union , which means that the Union as a whole loses all that money .

address problem	address problems	In this I refer particularly to the need to share information on best practices - we have to be prepared to address common and specific problems transparently and honestly - and to the recent judgments in the European Court of Justice regarding cross-border access to medical products .

make remark	make remark	Mr President , ladies and gentlemen , I just want to make a brief remark .
address problem	addresses problem	Madam President , Commissioner , the Daphne programme , which is designed to combat violence against children , young people and women , addresses an urgent problem , and it therefore deserves all our support and the proper scope for action .

address question	address question	At the request of the Council , the Commission is preparing a communication on air traffic delays and congestion and will certainly address this question again and propose initiatives in the field of airspace management .
address problem	address problem	Parliament , at its first reading , was particularly concerned to add an important extra objective , namely to address the problem of diesel fuel spillage on the highway , which has been posing an increasing safety hazard for road users , particularly riders of motor cycles .
address question	addresses question	This fuel spillage has resulted from inadequately fitted fuel filler caps , and the directive that we are now putting before you , with Parliament ' s amendments at second reading designed to tighten up those provisions , addresses this question by requiring motor vehicle fuel tanks to have positive closure mechanisms so that the cap is always securely closed .
make remark	made remarks	And I already made some remarks in my introduction on the relativity of forecasts , even if they are published , for the decision-making process .
make remark	make remark	There is another small remark I would like to make , Mr President , but it is important in the context of the motion for a resolution .
address question	addressing question	I am not ruling that out , but I want you to understand that in addressing your question in that way you should be aware that for progress to be made in that particular area , if it is intended to reduce the jurisdiction or the rights of Member States , Treaty changes would be necessary .
address problem	addressed problems	In welcoming this scheme , I hope that when it is reviewed in 2003 , if any of the problems I have mentioned have arisen , these can be addressed .

address problem	address problems	The Commission proposal does not specifically address the problems of air pollution in applicant countries ; and I think it is irresponsible , given the eminent enlargement , for Parliament not to be given any information regarding pollution levels in countries like Poland and the Czech Republic ; and the likely cost and time scale involved in bringing them up to exacting new standards .
pose question	pose question	I must pose the question : are we ordering our business in a correct fashion ?
address question	address question	We have to address very clearly the question of the judicial enforcement of this charter .

address issue	address issues	That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation , and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material .
address matter	addressed matter	In relation to Mrs Lynne 's question on interim payments : that is a matter that might very well be addressed by Parliament as it relates to budget issues .
make comment	made comments	Members , who , in the course of this debate , have properly praised Commission officials , who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity , hard-working and of great capability , are absolutely right in the comments that they have made .
make comment	making comments	Mr Newton Dunn , I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question , and I would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future .
recall memory	recall memory	We understand that , and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism .
address point	address points	A year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda .
make comment	make comments	I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner , who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate , to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings .
address issue	addressing issues	In fact , this directive , like so many others addressing environmental issues , is not good .
address challenge	address challenges	Is this House going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies , or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing Europe ?

address matter	addressed matters	All of these matters will be addressed in that legislation .
address situation	address situation	I welcome the legal base being set and the comprehensive way the new rules will , I hope , address this situation .
address issue	address issue	I want to address this issue directly because we in Europe are criticised unfairly for not taking human rights there sufficiently seriously .
improve system	improving system	Many Members have been working on the basis of trying to protect their own countries ' national interests rather than improving the overall system for Europe .
address issue	address issue	As far as criminal investigations are concerned , for which I am responsible , I take note of the invitation that was addressed to the Commission and the Council by several Members of the European Parliament to take this issue on board and to address it on a common legal basis , having regard to the relevance the interception of telecommunications may have as evidence before the courts .
address concern	addressing concerns	Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House .
address concern	address concerns	I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday , in the appropriate committee , more competently and in much more detail .
understand reason	understand reasons	The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia .
address need	address need	These NGOs will address the most urgent need which is to move people in danger to more secure areas as well as providing health care , water and sanitation .
make connection	made connection	It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified , where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two .
address issue	addressed issues	The most important issues that will be addressed this year will be the reform of the EU decision-making procedures , so that the enlargement process can take place in a streamlined and structured manner .
make comment	make comments	What more specific comments can he make about which sectors and which products will be concerned , and for how long ?
pose problem	pose problems	No exception has been moved for these under Article 2 ( 2 ) and the closure of incinerators following the entry into force of the directive would pose enormous problems of cost and of disposal of animal waste for UK farmers .
understand problem	understood problems	To save time I am going to assume that the respiratory and other health problems associated with ozone are understood , and that every Member of this House will want to reduce them .
address issue	addressed issue	I want to come to the issue which Mr Davies has addressed , namely , where we should start from .
make comment	make comments	Ladies and gentlemen , I would like to make a few final comments .
make comment	make comments	Whilst I was researching for these comments to make to you today , I looked for examples , because I think these illustrate so well to the citizens of the European Union how these developments will bring benefits to their lives .
make comment	made comment	People have rights and I do not think that the comment that was made yesterday was acceptable .
understand problem	understand problems	We understand as well , of course , the problems you are facing concerning the overlapping of programmes , creating problems of continuity for you .
understand problem	understand problems	We understand your problems , that they are not providing for you sufficient data in good time , especially with Objectives 2 , 3 and 4 , to enable you to ensure that the system works more effectively .
improve system	improve system	We also want to improve the rapid alert system , a system which is operated by the Commission to monitor the information on dangerous products and measures taken .

address issue	addressed issues	That was done into the Autumn and I have been assured that the issues that were drawn to the attention of the French authorities during that exercise have been addressed substantially in the responses by the French authorities .
improve situation	improve situation	We should have a frank and open dialogue on the policies needed by partner governments to improve the situation in this respect .
address issue	addressed issue	Investment is a major issue which was addressed at the important conference held in Lisbon on 29 February and 1 March .
reduce cost	reduce costs	I am totally in support of the idea outlined by Mr Ferber regarding the setting up of an interinstitutional recruitment office because I believe it will help reduce costs and reduce competition between the institutions in attracting new personnel .
make comment	made comments	Disciplinary procedures ? I do not think so , but I do promise to consider very carefully the comments you have made regarding both the no-smoking areas and attitudes towards the ushers .
improve service	improve services	My committee feels that the money , inadequate at the moment , should be used to improve the facilities and services offered , which is why we also want to see an overall strategy for the development of services , with a view to refugees and displaced persons being able to play a fully active role in society as equals .
reduce cost	reduce cost	There are obligations on financial institutions within the Union to substantially reduce the cost to consumers of transferring money from one euro-zone to the other .

reduce rate	reduce rate	I want to put it to her that it is far better to reduce the rate of growth in agriculture in order to protect the money that is currently going to the very poor in this world , because the alternative would be to squeeze further the budget lines in category 4 .
address issue	address issue	The other issue I should like to address is the contamination of gene transfer .
address issue	address issues	We must address those very real issues .

address issue	addressed issue	This is an issue that will have to be addressed in the future .
address challenge	address challenges	I support the thrust of this report , which is in line with the policy of budgetary rigour , because the major challenges that this Chamber needs to address are greater accountability and transparency which will involve embracing institutional reform with vigour ; secondly , the forthcoming enlargement of the Union and thirdly , a drive towards improving efficiency through effective budgetary control and better use of resources .
make connection	making connection	We must win the confidence of the European taxpayer and we can only do this by improving accountability through simplifying - not mystifying - the work of Parliament , by reducing jargon , by improving the process of approving legislation and improving the legislative machinery and by making a clear connection between what we do here and how it benefits the individual .
improve service	improve services	Rather than reducing the budget we should be looking at how we improve security services , and the question we should be asking is : should we have our own security services or should we be retendering it rather than just reducing the budget ?
address issue	address issue	Surely , when we are looking at budgetary rigour we have the right to address this issue because until we do so the general public will be confused about what we are doing in so many places .
reduce cost	reduce costs	However , we are trying to reduce those costs , especially on buildings .
cause death	cause death	BSE is a degenerative disease which does not cause sudden death anyway .

address issue	addressed issues	Clearly there are significant health and safety issues which can be addressed - not only for the protection of workers but also for the protection of their customers and the general public - and issues of customer health and safety of course are particularly relevant in relation to doctors in training .
address issue	address issue	Finally , I will address the issue of the risk of what happens if we do not get the staff and the resources to do the job .
improve system	improve system	There should be no more closures and we should make more finance available to improve the present railway system to have more goods moved by rail and not by road , which is totally unacceptable from an environmental point of view .

pay fee	pay fee	In the old days people went out and took risks with their lives and bad equipment ; today they have the capacity to know where the fish are , to get them , and to exploit them and they should have to pay a fee for that .
cause confusion	causes confusion	This report , whose name probably causes more confusion than clarity amongst those people who have not been following , the subject is in fact a number of separate amendments updating the original regulation .

cause uncertainty	causing uncertainty	This is particularly so in my home region , the West Midlands , where this delay is causing a great deal of uncertainty to local communities and the local taxpayers , who are having to underwrite the projects to the tune of many millions of pounds , pending the resolution of the problems I have outlined .
improve situation	improving situation	I know the Turkish authorities are looking at ways of improving the situation and so are the applicant countries and those which would like to be applicant countries .
address topic	address topics	In view of the large range of topics included in the Annual Report it will clearly be impossible to address all of them at our meeting today .
improve system	improving systems	Regarding the issue of cross-border retail payments , which has been raised by the European Parliament on various occasions , I recall that in September 1999 the ECB published a report entitled Improving Retail Cross-border Payment Systems - the Eurosystem 's View .
cancel project	cancel project	Better still , cancel the whole project and put all the funds into a special account to help defray the enormous costs that will be incurred when the euro is eventually dismantled .
address issue	addresses issue	The proposal provides not only for the protection of children 's health , it also addresses an internal market issue .
reduce cost	reduce costs	Finally , our proposal will help to reduce considerably the costs of patents in Europe by not requiring supplementary translations of the patent once it has been delivered in one of the three languages of the European Patent Office .
reduce cost	reduce costs	At the moment translation costs are the biggest problem when we try to reduce the costs and speed up the process .
address need	address need	But as you can imagine , in this new field we have to address the need to reinforce security on the basis of the subsidiarity principle , in the sense that we have to recognise that each Member State is entitled to adopt its own national legislation to guarantee law enforcement at national level .
improve work	improve work	We need to value this mechanism and use the experience of the people we represent , as expressed through their petitions to improve our work as a whole .
reduce cost	reducing costs	We also need to find other permissible ways of reducing the costs associated with transport to island and outlying communities .
pose problem	poses problems	I accept that free access to Europe for Mediterranean products poses problems for producers in our southern Member States , but surely this problem could be compensated at least to some extent in the CAP .
manage project	managing project	When I was a member of the Budgetary Control Committee and met the people who were managing this project , I was not at all impressed with the knowledge that they had of running such an enterprise , and I come from an industrial and financial background .
address issue	addressing issues	We can all take solace from the fact that the key protagonists in this difficult political equation are now addressing the most vexed and thorny bottom line issues that have to be resolved if a permanent peace agreement is to be put in place in the Middle East .
understand problem	understand problem	I do not understand the problem .
address point	address points	Could you perhaps address these points when you respond to our debate later on ?
address issue	address issue	Whilst I have some philosophical sympathy with Senator Hollings and his colleagues who consider that state-owned companies have some hidden and sometimes explicit advantages over their privately-owned competitors , the way in which Congress in the United States is trying to address this issue is contrary to both the spirit and the letter of US multilateral commitments .
improve service	improve services	EU leaders pointed to the need to improve our overall telecommunications services .
end contract	end contract	This situation was aggravated last summer when a decision was taken in the light of the report of the Committee of Independent Experts to end the contract with the technical assistance office which helped in the implementation of this programme .

address issue	addressing issues	Instead of engaging in this sort of interference , we should be addressing those issues where it is constructive for Member States to work together and develop some common standards .
read article	read articles	These two articles , in whatever combination , have to be read together .
reduce cost	reduce cost	There should be an agreed dispute-resolution mechanism available at local level , which can reduce the cost of settling consumer disputes because , as has been pointed out by many speakers this evening , there is the question of added costs with regard to resolution of disputes .
understand reason	understand reasons	Madam President , I would like to point out to my fellow Members and to yourself , that , whilst I understand the reasons which led you to go over the top and set such a full agenda for Wednesday , with regard to the political topics due to be discussed between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. , the Council and the Commission have exactly the same speaking time as all the Members of the European Parliament , i.e. 90 minutes for the Council and the Commission and 90 minutes for the MEPs .
improve system	improve systems	But there is room for the Commission to coordinate and improve evaluation systems as provided for in the Treaty and I was glad to see that the Commission was careful to emphasise that this is to be based on voluntary cooperation between the Member States .
make comment	made comments	Finally , I have made a few comments about the European Investment Bank taking a controlling interest in the EIF .
address point	address points	I would like to address the main points raised by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs ' report prepared by Mr Bushill-Matthews .

address situation	addressing situation	The twin-track approach I have set out underlines the value added of the Community contribution to addressing the health and environmental situation in the Balkan region .
improve situation	improve situation	The Commission confirms its commitment to strengthening our medium and long-term support to improve the environmental and human health situation in the Balkan region .
address point	address point	If he is going to reply to this debate , Mr Solana might like to address that point .
get opportunity	got opportunity	A wide range of NGOs got an opportunity to set out their views with regard to key country and thematic concerns and this input will no doubt prove helpful to the deliberation process .
address issue	addressed issue	Secondly , the difficult issue of flight time limitation was not addressed by the Commission .
address concern	addressed concerns	However , I want to say that there is great concern and anxiety about this particular Commission initiative and , indeed , about Mr Costa 's report , although I personally feel that many of those concerns were fully addressed in committee where , I know , there was widespread cross-party support for Mr Costa 's work .
pay tax	pay tax	Non-UK truck drivers do not pay UK road tax .
make comment	made comments	In the meantime - and here I also echo comments made in both the reports that we are considering - we should not wait for the charter to be in force to make more efforts to promote respect for human rights and democratic freedoms in the region .
address issue	addressed issue	This is a horizontal issue which should find a general solution instead of being addressed in every regulation and I hope we can proceed on that basis .
address issue	address issues	These are all issues which the Commission is urgently considering and will address in its proposal .
address issue	addressed issue	The specific issue of the number of inspections will be addressed in the report that I am requesting Member States to furnish me with .
address issue	addressed issue	I am not necessarily convinced that is the case , but there does seem to be some evidence to that effect and that is another issue that will obviously have to be addressed as well .
address issue	addressed issues	There are many complex issues which have to be addressed but I do not want to delay bringing forward the appropriate proposal for the pressure cooking of ruminant fat in the meantime .
address issue	addressed issue	This is an issue which must also be addressed .
make comment	make comment	Mr President , allow me to make a comment to Mr Byrne .
get chance	get chance	I am glad we get a chance to reflect on it and to look at the priorities .
address concern	address concern	As you know , from previous speeches , we are holding a debate within the Commission on how better to address this concern .
understand point	understands point	The point that I made to Mrs Gradin , which I am sure she completely understands - especially since I explained in full in my most recent letter , simply relates to that legal reality and the proper discharge of the functions of the Commission as a legally constituted organisation with obligations set down in law in the form of the Staff Regulations .
get result	get result	If there is a way in which you can alert those on the premises of Parliament to that fact that there is a vote and adjourn until they are present , maybe we will get a more representative result .
address issue	address issue	However , I would like to address one specific issue where the Commission and indeed all of us are rather weak : that is the issue of regulatory burdens .
improve situation	improve situation	We are proud of the fact that many countries in the world are desperately trying to improve their economic situation and they are using the Irish model as a reference .
address issue	addressing issue	Mr President , the issue we are addressing today , has divided this House and has evoked some strong emotions , particularly for the rapporteur , although she is hiding them well .
pay fee	pay fee	Here is a country which can enter into a trade agreement with the EU without having to join the club , without having to pay the membership fee or take on thousands of directives and regulations every year .
finalise agreement	finalised agreements	That is to say that I would not be content if the power was vested elsewhere in the EU , because the greatest sensitivity is that we as a country are having trade agreements affecting the UK negotiated and finalised by a third party , which may or may not be entirely in our national interests .
address issue	address issue	However , sadly , as shadow rapporteur I am unable to speak in support of many of Mr Ceyhun 's amendments , as I believe that these do not actually address the issue but could on the contrary have the effect of exacerbating it .
address situation	address situation	In doing so , we recognised that the proposals were far from perfect but they did at least attempt to address the present situation .
practice religion	practice religion	Whether it be the imposition of one 's religious beliefs or the denial of the right to practice one 's religion , one is as bad as the other .
address issue	address issue	I would just like to address the issue that various people such as Mr Mulder and Mrs Haug have raised , namely whether the aid should be the traditional 70/30 split between the EU and the Member States or whether we should go for a 50/50 split .

make comment	make comments	Having said that , I have four comments to make .
improve situation	improving situation	There the Commission supports , and indeed promotes , the initiative aimed at changing and improving the present situation .
address situation	address situation	So we must find this combination and address the situation .

pose problem	poses problems	It poses significant environment and health problems over its entire life cycle .
address issue	address issue	We also have to address the issue of the possibility of the emergence of a digital divide in Europe .
address crisis	addressed crisis	We now have a crisis in agriculture particularly and that crisis needs to be addressed .
address issue	address issues	Mr President , I feel it is exceptionally important that the budget guidelines should address important and major issues .
address issue	address issue	Let us hope that this report , together with the employment directive , will address that issue .
make comment	make comments	With so many amendments , it is not feasible for me to make specific comments on each of them .
address issue	addressing issue	Anyway the issue we are addressing tonight is the extent to which a Member State is permitted under a treaty to place restrictions upon nationals of other Member States or its own nationals , I suppose , from conducting intra-EU investment within the sphere of its economy .

understand reason	understood reasons	On the contrary , I said we fully understood those reasons , and that she has our every sympathy .
address need	addressing needs	For Chernobyl , important EU support is related to turning the sarcophagus into an environmentally acceptable system and addressing social needs .
address issue	addresses issues	Mr President , Commissioner , ladies and gentlemen , I would like to congratulate Malcolm Harbour on an unusually well-informed report which addresses many important issues .
address issue	addressed issues	The timing of the foreseen adoption of this report is very well chosen since the Commission is currently preparing the forthcoming communication of specific programmes implementing the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development in which issues included in Mr Harbour 's report will be addressed .
cause death	causes deaths	Smoking causes 85 % of all cases of lung cancer and half of all premature deaths among life-long smokers are caused by the use of tobacco .
cause death	caused death	The present directive will put the European Community at the forefront of efforts to control the death and disease caused by tobacco consumption .
address issue	addressed issues	The three main issues of the proposal were properly addressed in the common position , which also includes many of the suggestions made by Parliament in first reading .
get opportunity	get opportunity	We support , of course , educational exchanges of Erasmus , Socrates and so on in the European Educational Institute in Florence , but not enough students get the opportunity to experience Europe .
make comment	make comment	I make no comment on the issue that was being raised , but this is the second time that access to Parliament has been impeded by the same demonstrators .
address issue	address issue	We have to address this issue .
address issue	address issues	We should sort this out now and address the other outstanding issues more seriously and more successfully once the Treaty of Nice comes into force .
address issue	address issue	Madam President , I should like to address the same issue .
understand question	understand question	I fully understand this question .

cause confusion	caused confusion	Rejecting Nice would have caused delay and confusion .

address issue	address issues	Of course , this presidency is not yet over and there will be further opportunities to address animal welfare issues .
address matter	address matter	The Food Safety Authority will need to address this matter .
invest money	invested monies	I am speaking today wearing a number of hats : firstly , as the surrogate father of this report ; secondly , as the draftsperson of the opinion ; and most importantly , as one who sees the tremendous advantages which can be gained for the European Union from a harmonised system of UCITS investment to ensure that monies presently being earned in Europe but invested outside the European Union and not put to the benefit of the Union economy can be retained within the economy for the creation of entrepreneurship , employment and also for guaranteeing future pension rights .
invest money	invested money	The number of people employed for the amount of money being invested is again quite disproportionate .
make remark	make remark	It is very discourteous to make that sort of remark , openly in the Chamber , when the Member concerned is not present .
ruin career	ruin career	We have to set up facilities that fight doping on an international basis because , as we have seen , one false accusation can ruin a career or cast a shadow over an exemplary career , such as that of Linford Christie .
reduce price	reducing price	I heard Commissioner Lamy speaking before about trade relations with the US . Will the United States be reducing the price that they pay their farmers for their sugar as we are going to do , or are they going to continue with their very high support ?
address problem	addressing problem	We have also presented a resolution to the Commission on narcotic drugs in March 2001 addressing the problem of the diversion of precursors for synthetic drugs and this proposal attracted wide support .
pose question	posed question	I have a further question - in fact I agree with all the questions posed by the honourable Member from the PPE-DE .
address question	addressed question	At any rate not such typology has been conveyed to us by way of complaints , unlike in the case of DVD , which is the subject on which we are conducting the inquiry and to which your question is addressed .
address problem	address problem	So this evening I should just like to address what I believe is a crucial problem that needs to be looked at in the short term : the whole question of how we encourage the development of electronic commerce to use these tools , to address the sort of business issues that some colleagues are already trying to frustrate , in my view , by moving prematurely to the sort of rigid opt-in arrangement that they are talking about .
address problem	addresses problem	My Amendment No 1 addresses this problem and I have inserted the word `` review '' to replace the word `` reduce '' , in order to cooperate with colleagues concerned about this issue .
address question	addressed question	The question whether participation in decision-taking should aim at the public at large or the `` public concerned '' is a key point , and it has been addressed by a number of Members who have just spoken .
invest money	invested money	There is no other option : if the EU wants to become a credible global player in the new economy and the information society , substantive amounts of money should be invested in this domain as soon as possible .
address question	addressed question	I would like to draw the President-in-Office of the Council 's attention to the fact that she has not addressed the second part of my question relating to the fact that British Nuclear Fuels has not yet established the economic benefits of the MOX fuel plant , which it is obliged to do before it can commission it under existing EU regulations .

address problem	addresses problem	There is the ` Red Card to Child Labour ' action being taken by FIFA and the ILO to jointly combat child labour , a very good campaign that directly addresses exactly the problem we are talking about here .
invest money	invested money	As Mr Crowley has mentioned , in Ireland we have introduced a reserve fund where 1 % of GDP is set aside each year , and there are some billions in this fund now ; in fact there is so much money in it that people are beginning to fight over how and where it should be invested .
address problem	addressing problems	It is now a balanced compromise which allows a significant pre-trade transparency requirement to go ahead whilst at the same time addressing some of the practical problems with the original proposal - as Mr Bolkestein says , ` in a pragmatic way ' .
address problem	address problems	It is , as far as I am concerned - and I agree with the Commissioner - very definitely a measure that should address primarily the issue of air pollution rather than that of health problems associated with those who use paints .
address problem	addressing problems	Reaching agreement at first reading stage will enable this decision to enter into force quickly and be implemented by the Member States and would be a further concrete demonstration of the Community 's commitment to addressing the problems of climate change .
address question	addressed questions	The Commission has recently been increasingly informed about alleged situations of illicit trafficking in human organs in Mozambique and Albania , not least through written questions recently addressed by Mr Ribeiro e Castro and Mrs Karamanou .
pose question	pose questions	Every attack poses new questions which require new answers and pose new challenges that we have to address jointly through concrete action .
reduce price	reduced price	European sugar prices currently stand at nearly three times the world price , and these artificially high prices must be reduced .
understand meaning	understood meaning	After 30 January 2000 , they understood the meaning of ` environmental policy ' : to prevent pollution of this kind , in which 100 000 m3 of hazardous sludge leaked into the River Tisza , destroying its flora and fauna .
invest money	invested money	Extensive work is being done , but more money needs to be invested and the Commission , and indeed the European Union , could be the right source .
make remark	made remarks	Indeed in the remarks that were made by my ministerial colleague the Foreign Secretary in this House this afternoon , he made clear that ` failure to sign off accounts for the eleventh successive year , which is very poor , affects the climate of debate in all our countries ' .
address problem	address problems	I think we may have problems with this machinery directive , but the Commissioner must address that .
address problem	address problems	-- Mr President , the measures being proposed in the report being debated appear to want to address female unemployment and equality problems , but really result in cutbacks to and the abolition of any positive arrangements and rights achieved by women through the hard struggle of the working-class , grass-roots and women 's movement .
address problem	address problems	If there is a good service there , then we surely need to tell more people about it ; and if resources are needed and the problems are at Member State level , we need to try and address that .
address question	address question	So we care very much about what you have said , but we also believe that the various types of sources should be combined to address both questions which I underlined , one being the question of aiming for the top , of having the best for Europe ; and the second , the question of how to deal with the others which may not be in the best position today .
address question	addressed question	The European Union 's innovation level and investments lag dramatically behind those of its trading partners and competitors ; the question of state aid should therefore be carefully addressed .
stimulate debate	stimulate debate	Listening is at the very heart of Plan D . The Commission has implemented a series of activities to stimulate the debate in all Member States and has given support to those countries which requested it .
address problem	address problem	One reason we had so many problems in getting agreement on future financing was that the Commission missed an opportunity to address the root problem of the current financial framework , namely the lack of flexibility .
address problem	address problems	These are not just legal problems , President-in-Office , but a profound political crisis which we must address .
address question	address question	It is also right to address not just the question of the text , but also the context -- , the Hampton Court agenda , the issues that are close to people -- and then , in due course , in a new context , we can decide what to do about the text .
address problem	addressing problem	We are following closely the problem of Pakistan 's non-implementation of schedules under the South Asia Free Trade Agreement and addressing this informally with this country .
make remark	made remarks	I will , however , pass on the remarks that you have made to Vice-President Barrot in order to see whether anything further can be done , although as I pointed out in my reply to the question , the Commission does not envisage coming up with additional measures before the final results of the assessment - which is being carried out by an external consultant - are known .
address problem	addressing problems	I fully support the Presidency in calling for a ` dispassionate dialogue on the matter ' , addressing the problems ` in a spirit of understanding and mutual respect ' .
address problem	addressing problem	In a few weeks ' time , once we have properly analysed all the responses , we will publish the replies , together with a statement on the feedback we received , and before the summer we will outline the different ways of addressing the problem of mass claims .
finalise deal	finalised deal	Mr President , I intend to verify carefully whether this scheme can be used in this case and you will certainly understand that I can not take a position at this stage since the deal is not yet finalised and , by the way , a number of aspects are still being negotiated .
invest money	invest money	Believe me , there are many other priorities in the UK to invest this money in , and now that the European Commission has warned that Britain is in danger of going bust due to its high level of national debt , this country would be happy to have a significant reduction in its EU contributions , and I am sure that other countries would also be happy with a similar reduction .
address problem	address problem	Firstly , OLAF assists and supports law enforcement authorities throughout the European Union with their cases , and organises and coordinates Europe-wide operations : Operation Diabolo in 2007 aimed at counterfeit from China which is smuggled in shipping containers to the EU ; Operation Mudan in 2008 , to address the growing problem of smuggling of cigarettes by post ; and Diabolo II , which had the same objective as the first Operation Diabolo , which took place in September 2009 .
address problem	address problem	However , we do not support calls for an EU legal base and further directives ( as in paragraphs 10 , 11 and 27 ) to address the problem .
address problem	addresses problems	We have also started an infringement procedure to ensure that Greece addresses the problems that have prevented the reporting of reliable budgetary statistics until now and the Commission announced its immediate initiative on audit powers for Eurostat .
address question	address question	I might not be able to give detailed replies to all aspects of the question , but I am happy to address them in a possible follow-up question .
address problem	address problems	We need national measures to address national problems defined according to national circumstances and in full respect of subsidiarity , but set within a common European framework .
address problem	address problems	It seems that , for some , a centralised European economic ` government ' is indeed the ambition , but this would not address the problems we face : it would be bad for our citizens , for our Member States and , I say , for the European Union itself .
make remark	make remark	The second remark I would like to make is about an amendment introduced by Mrs Muscardini , which , in fact , proposes that this ` made in ' regulation would be a kind of pilot project that would be evaluated after a four-year period and perhaps changed .
address problem	addressing problem	They should take concrete actions to prevent and suppress trafficking and to protect the human rights of trafficked persons , and should play a greater role in addressing this significant problem .
make remark	made remarks	Whether we would prefer the African Union to have held its summit somewhere else is another question ; whether , indeed , we would have made some remarks to them on many occasions that perhaps they should .
invest money	invested money	Both European industry and the taxpayer have already invested huge sums of money in these projects and , as European lawmakers , we must continue to push forward well balanced , cost-effective and structural reforms .
address problem	address problems	This directive creates real problems for small shops and I hope the Commission will address it .
make excuse	make excuse	We need to make use of modern and easy means of communication , but please do not make that an excuse for having dismal paper means for publicising and contacting the ombudsman .
suggest idea	suggest idea	I suggest and cling to the idea that one side of the note and coin should be similar to the existing issuing notes that are issued by banks .
address problem	address problem	I congratulate the rapporteur and the Committee on Transport and Tourism on addressing certain issues relating to aviation safety , but I am afraid they have failed to address the problem of cabin baggage , a problem that both airlines and cabin crew admit not only exists , but is now causing concern .
make remark	made remarks	During the 1994 European election campaign , the Portuguese Socialist Party held a press conference at its headquarters at which Mr Campos made some remarks about Mr Arlindo Cunha , the former Agricultural Minister .
make remark	make remarks	I was moved to make these remarks by Sir Leon 's use of the expression ` diversion of attention ' when talking of Congress 's attitude to Helms-Burton .
address problem	addressed problem	This is going to become a big problem and must be addressed .
address problem	address problem	Mostly these small businesses have the problem of a narrow investment base and that is what we are trying to address .
make remark	make remark	Since we are having difficulty in getting Mr Crowley and Mr Dell ` Alba , let me make a general remark about the work of the Rules of Procedure Committee .
address question	address question	My group wants to ensure that when the European Central Bank is established and when the 11 countries create the euro zone , without prejudice to that price stability , we begin , with some urgency , to address the wider issues within the European Union , not least the question of growth and unemployment .
reduce price	reduce price	It is very clear that there is a strong move to reduce farm prices to world price levels and the levels of Eastern Europe to save money .
reduce price	reducing prices	Lastly , can I ask the Commission again to investigate why food prices to consumers are not reducing in line with the huge fall in farm prices ?
address problem	address problem	Finally , the debate on a `` balanced and appropriate policy mix '' should not be used to deflect attention from the structural reforms that are so urgently needed to address the euro area ' s serious structural unemployment problem .
invest money	invested money	We are talking about EUR 500 million or a billion , an enormous amount of money , which needs to be invested .
read book	read books	At least it seems so to me since I think that books exist to be read , or certainly that was the conclusion I reached when I studied English literature at university .
pose challenge	poses challenges	This poses enormous challenges for competition policy , which I hope it will be able to meet because , for certain , many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale .
address concern	addressed concerns	Thus , while complimenting Mr Viceconte on his report and finding a great deal in the resolution to commend , we shall be asking for a number of split votes to allow these concerns to be addressed .
make comment	make comments	I wish to make two comments with respect to the reports in front of us ; one on the Belder report , which contains a version of an amendment which I have tabled concerning the treatment of the Russian-speaking minorities in Estonia and Latvia .
address issue	address issue	It is not clear how the Commission can guarantee ethical security of services , but I fully share the view that we should take all measures to ensure respect for human rights ; existing actions , primarily the Internet action plan , address this issue .
get chance	get chance	Finally , Mr President , I would say that we continue to oppose the tobacco subsidies which are continuously being paid by the Commission and the sooner we get a chance to do something about it the better .
improve situation	improve situation	If the situation does not improve , do you know if there are any disciplinary procedures we could take against those Members who treat the staff in such a disrespectful manner ?
cancel project	cancelled projects	Nevertheless we are here now , and the Socialist Group supports the rapporteur ' s recommendation for adoption of this regulation with the minimum of amendments , already agreed in principle with the Council , in order to allow a fast-track , one-reading approval of the extension , and in reality to allow refugee support projects this year to go ahead rather than be cancelled .
determine outcome	determine outcome	The government must also allow the courts to determine the outcome of any challenge to election results in particular constituencies , and must respect their decisions .
address issue	addressed issues	Pillar II issues have to be addressed to the Member States but , given our related responsibilities under Pillar I , we take an interest .
organise conference	organising conference	Next May we are organising a conference with Unctad , in this Chamber , on the least developed countries and we are also organising a conference with WHO and UNAIDS on 28 September concerning malaria , HIV-AIDS and tuberculosis , the three major communicable diseases .
improve situation	improve situation	The reports by the Court of Auditors clearly show that there is room for radical improvement , and the Commission has already introduced a new Structural Fund regulation to improve the situation and will obviously be checking very carefully to see whether these reforms have gone far enough .
understand problem	understood problems	They kindly took me to Frankfurt , and I was told that they had changed their bonus policy , that they had understood the problems in project management , and so my report is , if not actually nice , then enhanced by this meeting with the ECB .
manage project	managed project	There are too many managers involved and , as a result , the project ends up not being fully managed .
finalise plan	finalised plan	This matter , which is of great interest to the Commission , has recently been dealt with in the Commission communication on the risk capital action plan which was finalised in October 2000 .
improve situation	improved situation	The human rights situation in those countries has improved dramatically and in the Baltic States with the build-up of the mixed economic system .
address concern	addressed concern	However , I want to say that there is great concern and anxiety about this particular Commission initiative and , indeed , about Mr Costa 's report , although I personally feel that many of those concerns were fully addressed in committee where , I know , there was widespread cross-party support for Mr Costa 's work .
get information	got information	The specifics of the involvement of the Guardia Civil in this particular issue is something that I have not got any detailed information on but I assume that the involvement is in the way that I have identified .
get idea	got ideas	What ideas and proposals have you got to continue the process of integration into subsequent EU presidencies ?
address issue	addressing issues	However , the report in no way affects the legislative programme , which is addressing such issues as traceability , labelling and liability .
cause reaction	cause reaction	Cosmetics containing any of 26 fragrances above a certain threshold are to be labelled with a warning which says ` could cause an allergic reaction ' .
get information	get information	Normally I do not take much notice of the lobbying information I get in this Parliament , in particular from industry , but I was amazed at ` Cosmetics - your choice , our responsibility ' from the European Cosmetics , Toiletry and Perfume Association .
address issue	address issue	Given that the Council is currently considering this proposal , and in view of the Commission 's strong desire to address this issue in a timely manner , I believe that the most appropriate course of action at this stage would be for the Commission not to accept formally the amendments put forward by Parliament , but to endeavour to take them on board as much as possible during the negotiations with the Council .
address issue	address issues	It is quite clear that we have to address exactly the same issues .
improve situation	improve situation	The draft resolution reflects the consensus between our institutions and Member States , with whom we have been discussing the subject over the last few months and who share our concern to improve the situation that was highlighted in such an impressive way by the petitioners .
make comment	make comments	I would like to make a few comments concerning the outcome of the recent Irish referendum , that was held on the Nice Treaty .
address concern	address concerns	Time for deliberation will be needed if we are to address the complex issues and concerns which arose during the referendum debate .
cause fear	causing fear	The complexity and the lack of clarity of the Nice Treaty allowed a huge range of issues to be tagged onto the debate during the Irish referendum , issues relevant and irrelevant to Nice , causing concern and fear among the people , which resulted in a huge abstention with a paltry 34 % turnout , of whom 54 % voted `` no '' .
pay tax	paying taxes	Given that UK hauliers are already paying the highest fuel taxes in the world , these proposals would be the last straw for many in the UK road haulage industry .
address concern	address concerns	I believe that we have now reached a sensible conclusion and would hope that the amendments adopted in committee , which address those concerns , can be supported in the plenary vote .
address need	addressed needs	The needs of women and children are specifically addressed in mother-and-child health programmes .
improve situation	improve situation	It is a balanced report with workable suggestions on how to improve the intermittently precarious oil supply situation .

improve situation	improve situation	From the end of 2002 it will help improve the situation of visiting motorists , namely those unfortunate European citizens who are victims of a road accident while they are outside their home country .
address issue	addressing issue	However , the policy of a one-year stop-gap extension of nut improvement plans does not seem , to the Commission , to be an appropriate way of addressing this particular issue .
stimulate growth	stimulates growth	Secondly , the current policy framework artificially subsidises aviation and therefore stimulates this growth still further .
pose problem	posed problem	But Mr Verhofstadt has to lead the Council towards a resolution of the problem , posed by the failure of Nice and by the Irish referendum .
address point	addressed point	A final word on police and security equipment , a point which is not directly addressed to the Commission in the report .
organise event	organising events	That is why the G8 is increasingly organising side events and meetings with third countries and civil society alongside the summit .
address change	address change	Therefore , when we talk about the Kyoto Protocol at Genoa , it is very important that we are able to do so in a way which leads to action on climate change and not the collapse of what has been an extremely important effort by the international community to address a major change .
make connection	make connection	These are the same people and we need to make that connection : the people who come here are actually the same sort of people who are living in camps .
pay tax	pay taxes	Mr President , on the subject of the use of the European Parliament 's own resources , I would like to say , both on behalf of the Pensioners ' Party which I represent and on behalf of the associated French , Dutch , Spanish , Swedish , Slovenian , Bulgarian and Lithuanian Pensioners ' Parties , who have authorised me to speak on their behalf , that I openly support the proposal that the European Union should levy its own taxes and that this should not mean an increase in taxation for the citizens but , on the contrary , a reduction in the taxes that the citizens pay in their own States .
address issue	address issues	I also raised during my last visit to China , the reports of torture and ill-treatment of the followers of the Falun Gong movement and there are other issues which we must address .
address situation	addressing situation	In the short term this means , in particular , ensuring free and fair elections and addressing the situation of missing opposition figures and political prisoners .
pay tax	paid tax	Any proposal that corporate tax be paid by SEs and could go into EU coffers is totally unacceptable .
get information	get information	All the honourable Members , including Mr Pomés Ruiz and Mr Dell ` Alba and others who have enquiries of that kind can , simply by referring to that table , get the most up-to-date information available to any one in the European Union , including the Commission itself .
address issue	addressed issues	We also have to bear in mind that there are other issues that have to be addressed , such as the manner in which companies are taxed and the way that is approached .
stimulate economy	stimulate economy	The priorities for the government are continuity and the preparations for European Union and NATO membership , with acceleration of political and economic reform , concentrating on tax reforms to stimulate the economy , squeezing out corruption , reform of the judiciary , modernisation of the customs service and border security , and legal changes to ensure that Bulgaria has a functioning market economy through amendment of banking laws and improvement in the bankruptcy laws .
address issue	address issue	We have to address that issue .
address issue	addressing issue	I believe that European Union airlines should not be afraid of addressing the issue of deep-vein thrombosis .

address issue	addressed issues	I am pleased to note that the amendments debated today in general are very supportive of the basic approach of the Commission to issues related to blood safety and the way these should be addressed at Community level .
make comment	make comments	With so many amendments . it is not feasible for me to make specific comments on each of them .
reject idea	rejects idea	We need to ask ourselves why the UK government has failed and why in particular it consistently rejects the idea of ring vaccination in the face of mounting calls from those in rural communities who want to adopt it .
address issue	address issue	This report is a very practical one , putting forward measures which actually suggest very concrete things which can be done to address this very difficult issue .
address issue	address issues	They will not address the actual issues in the workplace , but it is something which governments can do relatively easily .
address cause	address causes	Mr Schmitt said , and I wholeheartedly agree with him , that Member States have to do more to address the root causes that are forcing people to migrate across Europe and across the world , but it is not easy to address the root causes in the countries from where many asylum seekers come .
address situation	address situation	The highest number of asylum seekers in Europe come from Afghanistan , Iran and Sri Lanka and at the moment , as we know only too well , it will not be easy to address quickly the situation in Afghanistan : we watch that situation with some terror .
address issue	address issues	We can not afford not to address these issues .
address cause	address causes	In addition and crucially , Europe must collectively do far more to address the root causes that lead to people seeking asylum and becoming refugees .
address situation	address situation	To those - perhaps the British Conservatives - who will vote against this report in its entirety , if they were here I would ask them to explain to Parliament how we can address the current asylum situation in Europe without Europe-wide policies .
improve system	improved system	I like to think , at least in part , that this is a compliment to our free and diverse society , but we can not just have an open door , and maybe the French authorities need to reflect on whether their system could be improved .
address concern	addressing concerns	If all parties involved were to adopt a more positive attitude , the agreement would become a more effective tool for addressing the concerns of all participants in the future .
pose challenge	pose challenge	The very logistics of what is needed down the line , even on the basis of the best case scenario , pose a formidable challenge .
understand situation	understand situation	We are participating in the debate on how to organise things and to understand the situation as much as possible .
address issue	address issue	European governments have a responsibility to show leadership in the area of racism and xenophobia and politicians and civic leaders are failing to address the issue of racism in their own communities .
affect decision	affected decision	It certainly affected my decision this summer when I was buying a fridge and a freezer for my home .
address situation	addresses situation	National governments must retain the prerogative to formulate a budget which best addresses the particular and specific economic situation of their country at that time .
cause violence	causing violence	When ex-terrorists became the leaders of South Africa , Israel , the Palestinian Authority and a very large number of former colonies , they suddenly became reasonable and respectable people in the eyes of many , and their former opponents were blamed - rightly so - for causing the violence .
improve system	improve systems	Emphasis should be put on : the creation of alternative forms of employment in the drought-affected areas to improve the irrigation systems in use in these affected areas and , in general , improve water conservation ; the introduction of more drought-resistant and less water-hungry crops through further research into new crops , pilot schemes , model farms and whatever is necessary to farm in a sustainable manner in this environment .
make comment	made comment	Mr President , the previous speaker made a comment .
address point	addressed point	The question whether participation in decision-taking should aim at the public at large or the `` public concerned '' is a key point , and it has been addressed by a number of Members who have just spoken .
make comment	made comments	But it appears from comments being made by one of the Vice-Presidents of this Parliament in the newspapers and not to this House , that the whole issue is now not regarded as important by the Bureau .
address issue	addresses issues	The report addresses many of the tricky issues that have faced decision-makers since the demonstrations at Seattle , Stockholm and Genoa : it could lead to greater transparency and accountability since citizens could act as both a check on decision-makers ' complete autonomy and they could be more informed of the decisions which are being taken in their name .
understand question	understood question	The question of sound financial management of budgetary support is , I think , better understood , as a result of the work carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Commission ' s internal audit service , in cooperation with the various Commission services responsible .
improve situation	improve situation	We , therefore , have reason to hope that the situation will gradually improve .
address concern	address concerns	Simply calling it a development round without genuinely addressing the demands of developing countries is a sleight of hand that fails to address their real concerns .

address issue	address issue	Unfortunately , I must sadly inform you that a lack of political will on the part of the Chinese leadership to address the issue of Tibet in a serious manner has failed to produce any progress .
understand point	understand points	I understand exactly the points that Mrs Fontaine made but , I ask you , on behalf of all Members of this House , to keep us better informed of the process .
get information	get information	At this time , when we perhaps are being a little over-assertive with some of the legislation we are bringing forward , I do not want anyone to have to confirm why they have opted to receive , for instance , Ammunition Weekly or why they have chosen to get some information from Amnesty International .
understand point	understood point	Mr Harbour , your point is well made and well understood by the Bureau .
make comment	made comments	I hope that fellow MEPs will support the comments I have made , because we must remember that thousands of livelihoods are at stake .

improve system	improve systems	We acknowledge that recognition of judicial judgements and judicial standards requires trust in each other 's systems , but not blind trust , and for that reason I have put forward an amendment calling for urgent measures to improve judicial systems in our Member States , to encourage benchmarking , to encourage exchange of best practice .

address issue	addressing issues	The Spectrum Decision in its present form will set up a general and permanent framework for addressing radio spectrum policy and legal issues in the context of all relevant Community policy areas .

understand reason	understand reasons	However , we would contest the fact that neither of the two appendices is attached to the proposal , although we understand the reasons why .
get problem	got problem	So Slovenia has got a real problem .
end cycle	end cycle	The Council on Monday strongly encouraged the parties to take the first steps to end this devastating and self-fuelling cycle of violence that we have seen over the last 14 months .
address situation	address situation	Finally , not pre-judging the outcome of the consultations and handling them in the spirit of the Cotonou agreement is not only necessary to address the situation with Zimbabwe , it is also necessary to maintain mutual trust and confidence between the EU and ACP countries .
address issue	address issue	At the review conference , which is being held in Geneva from 11 to 21 December 2001 , the EU will present a common position on the issue of the unexploded remnants of war , requesting concrete steps to address this issue under the CCW framework .
address issue	addresses issue	If the EU Council Summit at Laeken this weekend only addresses the issue of the strengthening of borders as a response to this modern day slave trade , it will have failed not only to respect these values but also to fulfil its leadership role .

address change	address change	We also need further action to address demographic change through an integrated approach to safeguard sustainable and universal pensions .
address issue	addressed issue	But above all , we have addressed the issue of the non-binding short-term targets .

improve system	improved system	I would therefore like you to refer to the Bureau the question of whether the electronic voting system can be improved in order to really function as a secret ballot and protect Members from those pressures from which they ought to be protected .
address concern	addresses concerns	I should like to say that this report addresses many current concerns in the fisheries sector and certainly rebuilding the stocks of cod and hake is going to be a tremendous challenge .
address concern	address concerns	A dedicated working structure has been established to assist in developing concrete proposals that should address EU concerns , in particular as regards the application of the capital framework to a wide range of institutions , including smaller banks and investment firms .
pay tax	pay taxes	We can not invite people to the European Union only to say `` pay your taxes here , but do not expect any social services or social benefits in return '' .
improve situation	improving situation	This directive , part of a package of measures aimed at making our use of energy more intelligent , should disseminate the existing good practice of some Member States right across the EU , and will also be very important in improving the situation in applicant countries where energy-efficient buildings could do much to help their economies as well as protecting the environment .
make comment	made comments	I would like to know whether Mrs Zrihen will support them in light of the comments just made by the Socialist Group .

address issue	address issue	But given the fact that examination of this proposal is ongoing in the Council , and given the Commission ' s strong desire to address this issue in a timely manner , I believe that the most appropriate course of action at this time is for the Commission not to formally accept the amendments put forward by Parliament , but to endeavour to take them on board , as much as possible , during the negotiations in the Council .
reduce cost	reducing cost	That idea has been turned on its head by the economic realities of existing Member States - also by the performances of other Member States , such as in my own country in particular - Ireland , where an aggressive reduction in taxation policy , reducing the cost of labour and the income tax levy and ensuring that business can survive in a harmonious industrial relations environment with the majority of the earnings that the workers are getting going into their pocket and not going into taxation ; while at the same time , increasing the levels of protection that are available for those who are most vulnerable within our society and increasing investments in education and health .
