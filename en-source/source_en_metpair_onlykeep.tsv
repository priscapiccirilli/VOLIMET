find way	find way	We have worked with the Czech Presidency on this matter , and I very much appreciate the support of the Presidency in our efforts to find a viable way forward .
find way	find ways	It is our job , the job of politicians , not economists , to try to find ways - new ways and novel ways - of raising this particular issue .
find way	find way	Many of us have been involved in trying to find some way out of the planetary catastrophe that could ensue .
find way	find way	There is also a gap that we have yet to fill for people for whom no return to their country of origin is possible - for example , to Zimbabwe - and who are often left legally destitute , as it were , and , therefore , need to find a way to keep themselves alive .
find way	found way	So while we welcomed last night 's announcement from the American side of a six months delay , we are fundamentally opposed to this legislation in principle and we want to say that we think that the Americans , by bullying their allies , have not found the correct way forward .
find way	find way	We need to listen to that child as mothers do , and to help them find a way to reconcile home and work to the benefit of both .
find way	find way	We must keep trying to find a way through the maze .
find way	find way	But perhaps we could talk with you , Commissioner , and try to suggest ways forward with the associations that run hostels and similar activities internationally , and find a practical way forward so that parents can be sure of their children 's security when they send them abroad so that we have a quick practical solution to this problem rather than a theoretical one in the long term .
find way	find way	Open media can be intrusive and the problem with the Internet today is that we have to find a way of dealing with the various segments within which its operations take place .
find way	find way	I should like to give the Commissioner a hypothetical example : if a 62-year-old , registered blind official was working in an external office - in other words he is only three years from retirement - and he is comfortable in that office , can find his way around about it and there are no complaints about the quality of his work , would he think it a reasonable policy towards disabled people to consider compulsory transfer of that individual back to Brussels at that stage of his career ?
find way	find way	I would hope , too , that the European Commission will find some way of increasing the support to the programmes which will help children and young people as Romania begins in earnest its progress towards a closer relationship with the European Union .
find way	find way	Let us hope and pray that , for the sake of the American people as well as for the rest of the world , soon enough Mr Bush and his warmongering associates will also find their way out of office .
find way	find ways	The main problem now is not food or medicaments but it is basically shelter and trying to find some ways of earning a living in the months to come .
find way	found way	Any restriction of the present legislation needs to be duly justified and proportionate ; the least intrusive way has to be found to serve this goal .
find way	find ways	As I have said , we had to find ways not only to express tangibly the political will of all the institutions involved and the citizens , but also to do so in a legally sound way that would ensure that this will could face and withstand any challenges arising in the future .
find way	find way	We are just trying to find the best possible way to make it legally sound to be able to withstand any challenges before the court .
find way	find way	Anybody you speak to from the Palestinian area will tell you that it has always been the women and the children who have suffered most , but they have also been the most resilient in trying to find a way forward to challenge the failure to negotiate , the failure to respect and the failure to find a solution ; indeed , the failure of both Israel and Palestine to live up to their commitments , to agreements that they voluntarily signed up to , the failure of the United States of America and the European Union to live up to their commitments with regard to clear and open negotiations , the failure of other states bordering Israel and Palestine to take a more proactive and positive role with regard to , ultimately , achieving a two-state solution , which must be based on viability and equality .

find way	find way	Let us never lose sight of our common goal , and let us work together with the Arctic states and the international community to find the best and most effective way of preserving and protecting the Arctic for future generations .
find way	find way	We should find a way for negotiations to be very fair to everyone and not at the expense of the European agriculture sector .
find way	finds way	Between 20 % and 40 % of global industrial wood production is estimated to come from illegal sources , and up to 20 % of that finds its way into the EU .
find way	find way	Drugs grown and produced in Afghanistan find their way to the streets of Europe .
find way	find way	The Commission is open to discuss with Parliament in order to find a way forward that addresses Parliament 's concerns .
find way	find way	However , an incentive to find a way out of this vicious circle would be if we had open reflection without taboos and where we could analyse not only spending , but also the revenue side of the European budget .
find way	find ways	In the Commission , we are trying to find legal ways that respect the treaties to solve this problem , to protect data , and to try and enhance the Community pillar of this situation .
find way	find way	They contribute enormously to society and society must find a way to pay them back .
find way	find way	So that is why we have to find the right way to make them move .
find way	find ways	The experience we gain from these initiatives will allow us to find even better and more efficient ways to collaborate at a European level , making full use of both national and Community research programmes .
find way	find way	While we are trying to find our way out of the crisis , we encourage creation of work , including that of independent workers .
find way	found way	One way of doing that has just been found , and that is to foster the participation of the citizens themselves in the democratic life of the Union .
find way	find way	Hopefully we can find a way to do that .
find way	find way	We are trying to find a way to mobilise and activate the different levels through which we can achieve the most efficient actions and the best possible course of events .
find way	find way	Ultimately of course only the Greeks themselves can sort out the problems of the Greek public sector debt and we wish them well in their efforts to find their way out of the crisis .
find way	find ways	We also need to encourage innovation and research into alternative solutions and find ways around materials that European companies find too expensive .
find way	find way	We very much want to maintain close cooperation with the European Parliament as we pursue our common goals of gradually building up an EU Arctic policy and we must work together with the Arctic states and the international community to find the most effective way of preserving and protecting the Arctic for future generations .
find way	find ways	As it is doing in the cases of Libya and Côte d'Ivoire , the EU must continue to find creative ways within existing rules to make sure that human rights violators can never escape accountability .
find way	find ways	We believe we have to take practical steps : a comprehensive test ban treaty should come into force ; the fissile material cut-off ; support for peaceful uses of nuclear energy to find safe ways of making sure that we avoid proliferation - for example , the contributions we make to the nuclear fuel bank - and support for a very strong and effective IAEA .
find way	find ways	Adequate financing remains a very big problem , and we need to find innovative ways to finance the bottlenecks .
find way	find way	I can also say that the French and the Czech Presidencies made efforts that were crucial to find a way to meet the concerns of the Irish people .
find way	find way	It is a process that started in Laeken many years ago and has involved different democratic bodies and discussions over the years to try to find a common way of taking decisions in a more modern , more democratic and efficient way .
find way	found way	Its economy is in a serious situation and it is clear that a way out of this crisis must be found .
find way	found way	Their economies are in a serious situation , and it is clear that a way out from this crisis must be found .
find way	finding ways	So the future is precisely as your question suggests , finding new ways and new technologies , namely the development of cleaner cars .
find way	find way	What I want to do is draw those two things together , to find a way in which we can enhance what we do , to support the work that is going on , to make the Quartet more effective , to bring together what has been , in a sense , the Council and Commission operating side by side , and to meld it into one so that what we do on the ground really makes a difference .
find way	found ways	My argument is that if there is n't enough funding after inflation-only increases in Member State contributions , ways should be found to re-allocate budget lines to meet any shortfalls .
find way	find way	A practical example of cooperation between the Commission services is the ' Practical Guide to EU funding opportunities for research and innovation ' published in 2007 , which was conceived to help potential beneficiaries to find their way through the three funding Community instruments and provides policy makers with advice on coordinated access to those instruments .
find way	find way	But , even with all that cover , it can still find its way to the bottom of the pile and the leaflet that comes in the door is not put on display .
find way	found way	Until then , however , we have found a way which allows us to continue to enforce our own stricter requirements under the transitional period before we move , in line with other EU Member States , to the general regime .
find way	find way	We need to find a way to protect climate migrants , as they have to flee because we cause climate change .
find way	find way	I hope we will find a way to talk informally or in committee later on the proper formula .
find way	find way	So the issue is to find the right way of responding to two important needs : the need for freedom and respect of data protection , but also the need for security , because without security , there is no possibility of freedom .
find way	finding way	This work is crucial for the establishment of a future state of Palestine and crucial to finding a way to a two-state solution .
find way	find way	We should also find a way to control what we are importing from other countries outside the EU , especially in some northern European ports .
find way	find way	The question is , can the European Union find a flexible way , through a joint action , of responding in a coordinated manner to any future situations that might arise where persons are temporarily in need of international protection ?
find way	find way	Finally , Ms Sargentini , I really wanted to find an inventive way of saying that correlation tables were extremely important .
find way	find way	Will you find an appropriate way to report back to Parliament on the responses given .
find way	finding ways	I am confident that the Heads of State and Government and the parliamentarians here in the European Parliament will look at it in the spirit in which it is designed : yes , it is something a little different , but something which can provide an example of Europe taking a fresh direction and finding new ways to work together .
find way	find ways	Because of reform of the EU financial systems and reductions in structural funding and cohesion funding to certain countries under the Agenda 2000 reform package , it is essential that we find new ways of financing these very essential projects .
find way	find way	What assurances can the Council therefore give us that any produce that is sent from the European Union to Russia will in fact find its way to the actual people who need help ?
find way	find ways	In addition , Israel must find more effective ways of reconciling its legitimate security concerns with the urgent need for genuine Palestinian development .
find way	find way	We strongly condemn it -- there is never any excuse for terrorism ; but at the same time we ask Turkey to try to find peaceful interlocutors , try to find a political way and invest in the social and economic development of the south-east .
find way	find way	We need to find a pragmatic way of moving forward to ensure that we get clarity and an assertion of the principle you have outlined here today : that when it comes to a conflict between the right of the citizen to public services and the market , that is set down in legislation .
find way	find way	We have to participate in those as fully as we are able and with all the contacts that we have in order to find a way forward , so that we can get on with distributing the tsunami aid properly and look to a peaceful future for all .
find way	find way	The European Union now has to find its own way forward .
find way	finding way	Yet even injured and diseased animals which die on the farm are finding their way into rendering plants and the tallow from these animals is finding its way into the pharmaceutical industry , into the cosmetic industry and therefore into the food chain .
find way	finding ways	However , we need to play our part in finding ways to create fresh enthusiasm and acceptance for the roadmap as the way forward and , in this regard , the difficult task of engaging with Syria will be necessary .
find way	find way	We regret that the Framework Directive for Services of General Interest did not gain majority support : we do need to find a way to differentiate core essential services provided for the public good from the services we choose as individuals .
find way	find way	Therefore it is up to the parties involved to decide whether to keep this issue within the framework of the comprehensive settlement or to discuss it separately or to find a way to include it in both concepts .
find way	find ways	Of course , it remains open to groups of MEPs to find other ways of working , this already happens and I would expect that process to continue and expand .
find way	find way	One hopes that eventually this poor developing country will gradually begin to find a decisive way to much-needed peace and prosperity , for the benefit of all its citizens .
find way	find way	If we could find some way not only of having a measure to take against former Commissioners who act in this way , but also against the companies who benefit from their knowledge , then I think that we might have two very powerful levers to use in future transgressions .
find way	find way	I know that coming up with a solution to this problem and implementing it is not at all easy , but somehow we must find a way whereby Member States can have the last word , after being fully informed , in clearly reasoned decisions to accept or not the transportation of nuclear material -- or any other hazardous material for that matter -- through their territory .
find way	find way	The best thing that we can do today in the European Parliament is to encourage Prime Minister Zapatero in his efforts to bring together what were previously irreconcilable peoples to find a common way forward in the Basque region .
find way	find way	In my view , Parliament 's contribution might have been to try to help find a way of combining protection of workers with a flexibility that enables Europe to retain its competitiveness .
find way	finding ways	Fighting them means finding creative ways to bridge the gap between security sector reform and development assistance .
find way	finding ways	My fear is that the Socialist-dominated governments of Europe are hell-bent on harmonising taxes , on raising tax levels and finding new ways of penalising industry and entrepreneurship .
find way	find way	However , we must find a way around the problems .
find way	find way	I would appeal to the Commission to soften the severity of these proposals and find a better way .
find way	found way	It is precisely because I agree that I believe this Parliament should use this occasion to signal to the Court of Auditors its intense disquiet at the fact that a document of substance of the sort prepared by the Court should , whether correct or incorrect in terms of its content , have found its way into Der Spiegel of 8 November .
find way	find way	We must find some way of having a dialogue between the institutions over the next 12 months to make sure that these reforms take place and that we have the right kind of criteria for making sure that we are getting value for money from the staff .
find way	find way	As a lawyer in private practice in the UK , I myself , have often wrestled with a pile of books to find the right rules and the right way to go forward for my clients in these circumstances .
find way	find way	I can envision with some confidence that key amendments regarding , in particular , references to the core values of the Community - democracy , the rule of law , respect for human rights ; the protection of the Community 's interests ; reinforced evaluation and reporting provisions for the specification of an indicative financial envelope for the period 2007-13 ; or the inclusion of the review clause - will find their way into the final text .
find way	find way	If I were to arrange a round table with the industry - with dealers and manufacturers - would you be willing to come along to it and discuss with them how we can find a way through the problem while , at the same time , resorting to competition instruments if we have to ?
find way	find way	Ultimately we will have to do that and get the institutional balance right and find a way forward .
find way	find way	It is now up to the oil industry and to the governments in the countries which have no contingency plan to find some way out to offer people who own these cars , either through the marketing of lead additives or through the marketing of re-formulated petrol .
find way	find way	The body will have to find a way to attain a politically significant text compatible with insertion into the Treaty .
find way	find way	I know that is covered by the Committee on Civil Liberties , Justice and Home Affairs , but we must find a way of bringing together what we are doing in the Committee on Civil Liberties and the Subcommittee on Human Rights .
find way	find way	Of course , it is a long way ahead , so we need to find a quicker way of ensuring that the directive is implemented .
find way	find way	I hope that we will soon be able to draw conclusions from that and find the best way forward in preventing such incidents in the future .
find way	found ways	We particularly welcome the Council 's invitation to the Commission to make proposals as to how new and creative ways can be found to support the fresh opportunities which the peace agreement will bring .
find way	find way	I know that the European Parliament shares the commitment of the European Commission to give full support to the work of the German Presidency to find the right way forward .
find way	find ways	The Commission can take note of this and find other ways to give short-term humanitarian aid to both these countries .
find way	finding way	At the moment , because of the bureaucracy and the procedures for application in some countries , the money is finding its way disproportionately into middle class and wealthy areas .
find way	finding way	The first , to which the Commissioner has referred , is the way in which we have moved from a process of confrontation in the budgetary procedure to one more like codecision , as if , by magic , we are finding a way of blurring the distinction between obligatory and non-obligatory expenditure without having to go through a treaty revision to do so .
float idea	floated ideas	They are close to my heart too , so I can understand why other ideas have been floated to give form to these principles through other possible mechanisms .
float idea	floated idea	The Commission has floated this idea of a high-level trade and environment meeting in Geneva in the autumn bringing together top-level policy-makers to push forward the debate on how to strengthen the CTE 's work .
float idea	floats idea	The resolution floats the idea of a solidarity contribution on air tickets , but that should not be the only avenue , and like Mrs Kinnock I should like to suggest other possibilities .
float idea	float idea	But , frankly , I find it extraordinary that Mr Solana and Mr Blair and several others can float the idea of creating an executive committee formed out of the Council presidency without referring to the role of the European Commission .
float idea	floated idea	The idea of a special Lebanon Summit within the Arab League framework has recently been floated .
float idea	floated idea	The first is the creation of a European Monetary Fund , which is absolutely necessary and was an idea also floated by Mr Schäuble , the German Minister for Finance .
float idea	floated idea	In this question we have also floated the idea of establishing a reserve compensation fund , but this must not be seen as a demand on our part or by the Commission .
float idea	floating idea	I am just floating the idea .
float idea	floated ideas	Many ideas have been floated on a comprehensive approach to peace in the Middle East .
float idea	floated ideas	I noted with interest the ideas being floated on the possibility of supplying fishing vessels from the Commission , that is to say , European Union fleets to the fishing communities in the affected countries .
flood market	flood market	Equally , in relation to sheepmeat , important to European , and particularly Irish , farmers - badly managed arrangements with New Zealand mean there are no controls to prevent a deliberate New Zealand policy to flood the EU market at peak production periods .
flood market	floods market	But in micro-economic terms at the level of the salmon industry consider the implications of Norway , a state outside the Union which produces a massive surplus for export - and has the potential to produce much more in the immediate future - and floods our market to such an extent that the anti-dumping case when it is examined will hold .
flood market	flooded market	It is a sensible solution allowing Member States to monitor and control the market and make sure it is not flooded .
flood market	flood market	It is paramount that these directories are given prominence in the UK market and are not expunged by allowing EU companies to flood the British market under the aegis of EU trade legislation .
follow activity	follow activities	This development should continue , and I know the Commission will continue to follow closely the Ombudsman 's activities and welcome his proposals .
frame debate	frame debate	Most importantly , we will have to further frame the international debate after 2012 .
fuel debate	fuel debate	Mr President , yes , I am indeed glad that the Commissioner has understood that we are calling for the drawing up of a Green Paper without delay in order to fuel a more in-depth debate on the Commission 's proposals .
grasp concept	grasp concept	Still unable to grasp the concept of the single market , such national authorities should be put to the test of Commissioner Monti 's single market scoreboard .
grasp point	grasp point	The Chinese seem unable to grasp the essential point , pointed out by Mr Watts and others , that it is not simply a money-making city ; its economic welfare depends on the wellbeing of its citizens , and that point has yet to be grasped .
grasp situation	grasp situation	We need a few days to grasp and to assess the situation in the Constitutional Court .
juggle life	juggling life	We can legislate against discrimination in the workplace , but we can not legislate against the pressures of juggling work , family life and managing a home .
kill process	kill process	I definitely do not want to lower expectations but I would be very careful not to raise expectations so high so that those who do not want the international negotiations to succeed could kill the process after Mexico if we do not achieve anything .
kill proposal	kill proposal	I think we should not kill the proposal , but it is obvious that there is no consensus at this stage .
leak report	leaked report	I would also like to take the opportunity to refute the untrue allegation made by the Pakistan ambassador in Washington that the EU/EOM leaked an interim briefing report .
mount campaign	mount campaign	It is equally clear that Europe does not have the resources for a European defence identity : we can not mount a campaign without American and NATO support .
mount exhibition	mounting exhibition	May I thank the Commission for that programme and Mrs Perez Latorre in particular for her help in mounting the exhibition .
mount exhibition	mount exhibition	It is normal practice , as Members of this House will recognize , for Council presidencies to mount an exhibition of a cultural , social or historical nature in the conference part of the Justus Lipsius building .
pour money	pour money	The UK will continue to pour increasing amounts of money into Brussels , yet the one area where some of that money is recouped - albeit very little - is the area the Commission are looking to axe .
pour money	pouring money	No nation should be pouring taxpayers ' money into a corrupt system .
pour money	pour money	I want the Commissioner to ensure that whatever is brought in is unified throughout the European Union and is financed in a unified way so that no one Member State can pour in more money than another to support their particular industry .
push drug	pushing drugs	Where the Pirker text puts the case for enforcement penalties for trafficking , pushing and consumption of synthetic drugs , the Greens seek to delete the reference to consumption .
shake confidence	shake confidence	It would encourage extremist forces and shake business confidence , and nothing would be achieved that can not be achieved by other means .
